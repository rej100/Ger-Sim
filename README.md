# A german simulator.

This will be built using the newest version of `ionic` and `Angular 4`, this is my first non-malware android app and i'm pretty excited to finally try using higher abstraction level frameworks.

### Warning! This project is messy!

### Getting this up and running
First off, to work with this, `cd` into the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

To get a live preview of what you're doing run:

```bash
ionic serve
```

To compile the thing run:

```bash
ionic cordova build android
```

or:

```bash
ionic cordova build ios
```
### Atom editor tip
The ```TypeStrong``` Typescript plugin for atom is really useful, strongly recommended.
